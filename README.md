## Introduction
> This project aims to perform facial recognition from a database of faces. It can be used in various implementations
> such as cameras for security and healthcare monitoring and hotel check ins/school attendance.

*Note: This project was created as part of BWSI CogWorks Week2 Vision Capstone project*
*Presented by Team We Love Bytes 2024*

## Features
These are some important features that our program can accomplish:
- [x] A fully trained Facenet model
- [x] Face-detection system
- [x] A database of recognized faces (includes Edwardia Fosah (one of this project's contributors), Davido, Lana Del Rey, Malcolm X, Issac Newton, Rema, Steve Lacy, and Taika Waititi initially)
- [x] Loading new faces to the database via dialog prompt
- [x] Recognizing known and unknown faces
- [x] Prototype** Whisper algorithm
